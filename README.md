# CSCI325
## Summary
This repository includes all necessary source code, screenshots, and documentation for the CSCI-325 program required for the Senior Portfolio for student 163119.

## What the program does
This program uses a hash code function to store a student as a hash of their ssn or some other unique nine-digit identifier.

## How to compile it
*NOTE:* This program is **not** intended to be run as an independent program, but instead as a component within a larger program.  Grading of this program was done by the professors own proprietary test program.  A test function was written within the CSCIHashTable.java file that demonstrates the use of the full program.
*NOTE:* These instructions assume standard Linux OS, terminal, Java SDK, and Eclipse IDE are installed.
1. Open Eclipse
1. Import entire project folder
1. Run CSCIHashTable.java file
